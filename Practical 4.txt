PRACTICAL NO. 4
Aim:SSH Command in Linux

Theory:
The ssh command provides a secure encrypted connection between two hosts over an insecure network. This connection can also be used for terminal access, file transfers, and for tunneling other applications. Graphical X11 applications can also be run securely over SSH from a remote location.

Other SSH Commands

ssh-keygen - creates a key pair for public key authentication
ssh-copy-id - configures a public key as authorized on a server
ssh-agent - agent to hold private key for single sign-on
ssh-add - tool to add a key to the agent
scp - file transfer client with RCP-like command interface
sftp - file transfer client with FTP-like command interface
sshd - OpenSSH server
